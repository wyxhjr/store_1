# Contributions are welcome! 

We believe in open-source code development and hence all contributions that helps to grow and build BaM are most welcome. Please note that the BaM is in early stage of development and rapidly iterated to support more functionalities as required. However, the goals of BaM system will remain in-tact while the codebase will be evolving over time. To this end, we request developers who are interested in contributing to frequently update the codebases. 

## Reporting bugs and asking questions

Please open a github issue request for posting questions, issues or feedbacks. We try to respond as early as possible. 

## To Contribute

Please create pull request for all contributions. We currently have not enabled CI/CD pipeline on BaM codebase and hence all code will be going through manual review process. If anyone is interested in building CI/CD pipeline, your contributions are most welcome. 

### PR process
Each PR will have an assignee and will engage with the contributor to merge the PR. Please actively ping assignees after you have addresses the comments requested.
